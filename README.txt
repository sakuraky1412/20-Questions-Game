It is a Java program for restricted and unrestricted game of 20 questions


There are jar files created for you to run. No configuration or command lines needed.

I implemented a background image (java.awt.Image) and two JOptionPanes (javax.swing.JOptionPane).

I tried to play music when a button is clicked in the unrestricted version; however, it is not working. The computer could not find the music file, even though I typed the name right and put it in the right folder. (sun.audio)

I also came up with an almost successful method to update the character name list.

Java docs can be found in the doc folder.

Hope you enjoy!
